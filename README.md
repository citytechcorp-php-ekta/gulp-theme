===

Hi. I'm a starter wp theme called `gulp-theme`, my moto is making development firster than ever and deploying them easier than ever and lastly site will load faster than ever.

How awesome, isn't it? Let me describe how would you make it happen.

* Installing Gulp & Bower & node sass by- npm install -g gulp bower node-sass

After setting up configuration you can follow the steps given below.
* Open CMD or Gitbas or Putty to go dev folder and cd to wp theme directory like /project/wp-content/themes
